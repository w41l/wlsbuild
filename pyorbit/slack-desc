pyorbit: pyorbit (Python bindings for ORBit2)
pyorbit:
pyorbit: PyORBit is a Python binding for the ORBit2 CORBA ORB. It was developed
pyorbit: to suit the needs of the bonobo bindings in GNOME-Python, but is usable
pyorbit: for other purposes as well. It aims to follow the standard Python 
pyorbit: language mapping for CORBA. It can generate stubs at runtime from 
pyorbit: typelibs, IDL files, or by introspecting remote objects using ORBit2's
pyorbit: IModule typelib capabilities.
