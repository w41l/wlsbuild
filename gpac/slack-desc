# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

gpac: The original development goal is  to provide a clean (a.k.a. readable
gpac: by as many people as possible), small and flexible alternative to the
gpac: MPEG-4 Systems reference  software  (known as IM1  and distributed in
gpac: ISO/IEC 14496-5). The  MPEG-4  Reference  software  is  indeed a very
gpac: large piece of software, designed  to verify the standard rather than
gpac: provide a small, production-stable software.
