# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

libunique3: libunique3 (Single Instance Library Version 3)
libunique3:
libunique3: libunique is a library for writing single instance application. If
libunique3: you launch a single instance application twice, the second instance
libunique3: will either just quit or will send a message to the running instance.
libunique3: libunique makes it easy to write this kind of applications, by providing
libunique3: a base class, taking care of all the IPC machinery needed to send
libunique3: messages to a running instance, and also handling the startup
libunique3: notification side.
